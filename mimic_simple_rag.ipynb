    "# MIMIC-III Simple RAG Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a complete implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using MIMIC-III admission data from BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Access to MIMIC-III through PhysioNet credentials\n",
    "2. A Google Cloud project with billing enabled\n",
    "3. OpenAI API key stored in a `keys.env` file\n",
    "4. All required packages installed from `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file named `keys.env` with your OpenAI API key:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update the Google Cloud project name:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   os.environ[\"GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT\"] = \"your-project-name\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run all cells sequentially to see the complete RAG pipeline in action\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction**: Fetches admission records from MIMIC-III\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Implements different chunking strategies \n",
    "3. **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector representations of text chunks\n",
    "4. **Retrieval Functions**: Implements both FAISS and cosine similarity methods\n",
    "5. **Generation**: Combines retrieved context with an LLM to generate answers\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Measures and compares retrieval performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook compares two retrieval methods (FAISS and cosine similarity) and demonstrates that both achieve comparable performance on this dataset. The visualization at the end provides a clear comparison of their metrics."

    "## Understanding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG combines the power of retrieval systems with language generation models to create more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant information from a knowledge base\n",
    "   - Convert the query to an embedding vector\n",
    "   - Find similar vectors in the knowledge base\n",
    "   - Retrieve the corresponding text chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is added to the prompt sent to the language model\n",
    "   - Provides factual grounding for the model\n",
    "   - Limits hallucination by keeping the model focused on relevant facts\n",
    "   - Enables up-to-date information beyond the model's training data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generation**: The language model creates a natural language response based on the query and retrieved context\n",
    "   - Synthesizes information from multiple chunks if needed\n",
    "   - Presents the answer in a coherent, human-readable format\n",
    "   - Can be instructed to cite or reference the retrieved information\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple implementation demonstrates these core concepts with MIMIC-III admission data. In healthcare applications, RAG is particularly valuable for:\n",
    "- Answering questions about patient records\n",
    "- Providing evidence-based clinical information\n",
    "- Summarizing medical literature\n",
    "- Supporting clinical decision making with relevant context"

    "- **Hierarchical Splitting**: It attempts to split text on a list of separators in order (paragraphs, then sentences, etc.) rather than arbitrarily breaking text\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: By using meaningful separators, it maintains the semantic integrity of chunks\n",
    "- **Customizable**: We can define the exact separators in order of preference\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple demo with admission data, we set a small `chunk_size=100` because:\n",
    "1. Our admission records are already short (single lines)\n",
    "2. Each record contains complete information about one admission\n",
    "3. Smaller chunks are more precise for retrieval in this case\n",

    "## Note on Evaluation Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG evaluation often focuses on whether retrieved documents contain specific text that matches expected answers. However, with our admission data, this approach has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Text Context**: Our admission records are very brief with minimal information\n",
    "2. **Date-Based Reasoning**: Many queries require date interpretation rather than simple text matching\n",
    "3. **Need for Inference**: Answering questions like \"admissions in the 2180s\" requires reasoning beyond direct text matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using text-matching metrics, we'll evaluate our RAG system by comparing:\n",
    "1. The base RAG implementation's answers\n",
    "2. The improved RAG implementation with better prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison will demonstrate how enhancing the generation component can significantly improve RAG performance even when the retrieval component remains unchanged."

    "## 7. Evaluation and Prompt Improvement\n",
    "Looking at our query results reveals some interesting patterns and limitations of the current RAG implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date Handling Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **De-identified Dates**: The years in MIMIC-III (like 2139, 2198) appear futuristic because they've been intentionally shifted forward in time. This is a standard de-identification technique that preserves temporal relationships while protecting patient privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Date Format Recognition**: While the retrieval component successfully found records with February dates (e.g., \"2109-02-16\", \"2198-02-09\") for the query \"Who was admitted in February 2139?\", the generation component didn't recognize that:\n",
    "   - The format \"YYYY-MM-DD\" indicates that \"02\" represents February\n",
    "   - It didn't match partial date components (finding any February admission)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Numerical Reasoning**: For the query about \"admissions from the 2180s,\" the system retrieved a record from 2190 but still answered \"No\" - indicating the LLM isn't performing numerical reasoning or range matching on the dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG System Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations highlight common limitations in basic RAG implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval vs. Understanding**: The retrieval component finds semantically similar text, but doesn't \"understand\" the content's meaning or structure\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Literal Matching**: The generation component tends to look for explicit matches rather than inferring relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited Reasoning**: Without specific instructions, the LLM doesn't perform calculations or logical operations on the retrieved information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll implement one simple but effective improvement: enhancing our system prompt to instruct the LLM to perform more analytical reasoning on the retrieved content, particularly for date-related queries."

    "## Comparing Regular and Improved RAG Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments with both the regular and improved RAG implementations reveal significant differences in their ability to interpret and reason with retrieved information, despite retrieving similar contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences in Response Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "| Query | Regular RAG | Improved RAG | Analysis |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| How many subjects have ID numbers below 5000? | \"None of the subjects mentioned have ID numbers below 5000.\" | \"Two subjects have ID numbers below 5000.\" | The improved RAG correctly analyzes numerical values in subject IDs. |\n",
    "| List all patients admitted in the year 2109 | \"Subject 9396 was admitted in the year 2109.\" | \"Patients admitted in the year 2109: - Subject 9396, HADM 106469, admitted on 2109-02-16 23:14:00\" | Both identify the same patient, but improved RAG provides more structured, complete information. |\n",
    "| Was anyone admitted at night after 10 PM? | \"Yes, Subject 9396 was admitted at night after 10 PM.\" | \"Yes, Subject 9396 with HADM 106469 was admitted at night after 10 PM on 2109-02-16.\" | The improved RAG provides more contextual details. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes the Improved RAG Better?\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved prompting significantly enhances the LLM's ability to interpret and reason with the retrieved information. Both systems retrieve essentially the same contexts, but the improved system produces more accurate, detailed, and structured responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improvements in the Enhanced Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Date Format Instructions**: We provided clear instructions on interpreting the YYYY-MM-DD format, helping the model understand date components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specific Reasoning Instructions**: We added detailed guidelines for:\n",
    "   - Month identification (e.g., \"02\" means February)\n",
    "   - Decade ranges (e.g., 2180s means 2180-2189)\n",
    "   - Temporal comparisons (identifying \"most recent\" or \"earliest\" dates)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reasoning Permission**: We explicitly encouraged the model to perform analysis on dates and numerical values, even when there isn't an exact match to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Approach Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This improvement targets a fundamental challenge with RAG systems: the disconnect between retrieval (finding relevant text) and generation (understanding what that text means).\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing the LLM with a \"schema\" for interpreting date information and numerical values, we've created a lightweight reasoning layer between retrieval and generation. This effectively bridges the gap without requiring complex code changes or preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explaining Retrieval Results and top_k Trade-offs\n",
    "In this demo, we use top_k=3 to select the three most similar chunks for the LLM prompt. This approach helps manage token limits, reduce cost, and keep the context focused on the most relevant data. However, it comes with trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Context:\n",
    "Only three chunks are used, which means some queries (like \"How many subjects have ID numbers below 5000?\" or queries about admissions in the 2180s) may not include all the necessary information. For example, although there are 9 subjects below 5000, only a few show up in the top three retrieved chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use top_k?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Keeps the prompt small, fitting within token limits.\n",
    "- Reduces cost and improves speed by limiting the amount of data sent to the LLM.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Important information might be missed if it's not in the top three.\n",
    "- Increasing k (e.g., to 5 or 10) could capture more details but might also introduce irrelevant data and increase token usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This balance—between a focused context and comprehensive data—is a fundamental challenge in RAG systems. While our improvements have enhanced LLM performance, the limited context due to top_k=3 remains a constraint when handling larger datasets. Future iterations can experiment with different top_k values to optimize this trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broader Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt engineering technique can be extended to other domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medical Terminology**: Instructions for interpreting lab values, medication dosages, or diagnostic codes\n",
    "- **Financial Data**: Guidelines for processing monetary values, percentages, or trends\n",
    "- **Legal Information**: Frameworks for interpreting statutes, case references, or jurisdictional details\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that effective RAG isn't just about retrieval quality—it's equally about giving the LLM the right \"tools\" to interpret the retrieved information correctly."
